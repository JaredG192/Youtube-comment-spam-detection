# Youtube-comment-spam-detection
In this project, we aim to create a system that can automatically distinguish between spam and non-spam comments on YouTube
This involves studying the common patterns seen
in spam comments and training a machine learning model to
recognize these patterns. By learning from ex-amples of both
spam and legitimate comments, the model can predict
whether new comments are likely to be spam or not. Our goal
is to build a tool that accurately filters out spam without
mistakenly blocking valid user input. By improving the way we
classify spam comments, we can help create a cleaner, more
enjoyable space for YouTube users
